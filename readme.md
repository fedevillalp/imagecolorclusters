# Finding Van Gogh's favorite colors using using k-means clustering on 1000+ paintings.

This code was used to a) scrape 1000+ Van Gogh paintings , b)  perform k-means clustering on each painting to identify the dominant colors in each painting and c) perform k-means on the ensemble of clusters from all the images to find Van Gog's favorite colors.

The pixel information of each image was transfotmed into three R, G, B vectors pror to performing k-means clustering. 

The final overall cluster centroids were then transformed back to RGB values and plotted to depict Van Gog's favorite colors.
