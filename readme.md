# Finding the dominant colors in a painting using k-means clustering.

This program takes in an image and returns a plot of the dominant colors in the image. 

It does so by transforming the pixel information into three R, G, B vectors and performing k-means clustering.

The cluster centroids are then transformed back to RGB values and plotted to depict the dominant colors.
